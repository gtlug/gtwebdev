   <p>The <strong>Grand Traverse Area Web Development Group</strong> was formed as a <em>spin-off</em> of our local <a href="http://www.gtlug.org" title="GTLUG">Linux Users Group</a>.  We exsist soley as a member contributed organization in which we explore the many facets of Web Development.  Such explorations may include, but are not limited to...</p>

   <ul>
      <li>New Trends in Web Technology</li>
      <li>Programming Techniques</li>
      <li>W3C Compliance (HTML, XML, CSS, etc.)</li>
      <li>SQL</li>
      <li>PHP</li>

      <li>Java Servlets &amp; JSP</li>
      <li>Javascript/ECMAScript</li>
   </ul>
   <p>This group is member driven, so any realm of topics, members see fit, within the domain of web development is acceptable for group discussion.  Since this is a <em>spin-off</em> of the LUG, you can expect that we\'ll at our core be discussing various implementations of Linux/Apache/MySQL/PHP (LAMP) environments.  Again, this isn\'t set in stone, and you the members decide what we really talk about.</p>
